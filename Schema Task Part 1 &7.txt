Part 1:
1-What is a schema in SQL Server?
A schema in SQL Server is a logical container that groups database objects such as tables, views, stored procedures, etc., under a specific name, often used for managing access and organization.
2-How is a schema different from a database?
A database is a complete storage system that holds data and objects, while a schema is a subset within a database that organizes those objects. 
3-List at least two benefits of using schemas in real applications:

-Security management: Permissions can be set at the schema level to control access to groups of objects.

-Organizational clarity: Objects can be grouped by functionality, team, or application module, improving maintainability.
4-Can different schemas have the same table name?
Yes, different schemas within the same database can have tables with the same name (e.g., sales.Orders and hr.Orders).


Part 7:
1- What are the advantages of separating tables into schemas in a large system?

-Better organization: Tables related to different modules or departments are logically grouped, making the system easier to understand and manage.

-Simplified maintenance: Changes and updates can be made more efficiently when related objects are grouped.

-Avoids name conflicts: Allows the same table name in different schemas without conflict (e.g., finance.Employees vs hr.Employees).

2-How can schemas support security and access control?

-Role-based permissions: Access can be granted to specific schemas, allowing users to interact only with relevant data.

-Minimized risk: Sensitive data can be isolated in specific schemas, reducing the chance of unauthorized access.

3- Suggest a new department that could be added to this system and which tables it would manage:

-Suggested Department: IT Support

-Tables it could manage:

support.Tickets – stores IT support requests

support.Assets – tracks company devices and software

support.Users – logs users and their assigned equipment
